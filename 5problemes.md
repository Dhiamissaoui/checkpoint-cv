-- 5 clear mistakes with one-line fixes for each:



* Missing space in heading (“Professional ExperienceProject Manager”)

&nbsp;→ Fix: Professional Experience on one line, Project Manager on the next.



* No dates for Project Manager role 

&nbsp;→ Fix: Add dates like Jan 2020 – Present.



* Weak, vague bullet points → Fix: “Managed various projects successfully”

&nbsp;→ “Managed 6+ projects delivered on time and budget.”



* Inconsistent date format (“May 2018 to Dec 2019”)

&nbsp;→ Fix: Use one style everywhere, e.g., May 2018 – Dec 2019.
